# Current Source of Truth — Bazar Baz

Date: 2026-06-25

## Current validated baseline

The current working baseline after P30/P31/P33 overlays is source-validator green.

Minimum target-machine gate for any implementation phase:

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm run db:validate
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run build
pnpm run quality:local
```

Clean handoff gate introduced in P33:

```powershell
pnpm run release:stage
pnpm run quality:release-staged
```

Database/migration gate when database credentials and PostgreSQL client tools are available:

```powershell
pnpm run db:drift
pnpm run db:migrate:neon:dry-run
```

## Current product and architecture state

- Next.js 16 App Router with localized routes under `app/[locale]`.
- Supported locales: `fa`, `en`, `ar`; dictionary leaf-key parity is enforced by `quality:i18n-completion`.
- Multi-tenant organization model supports `SHOP` and `APPOINTMENT` organization types.
- Dashboard workflows cover appointments, calendar, organizations, members, products, product categories, orders, QR code, services, service categories, settings, and users.
- Public shop workflows cover shop profile, product detail, checkout, order tracking, and shop fanpage.
- Public appointment workflows cover organization profile, service listing, staff listing, booking, appointment detail, my appointments, and appointment fanpage.
- Follow support exists through `Follow`, `follow.service.ts`, follow/unfollow API, public follow UI, and readiness validators.
- Fanpage MVP exists through `FanpagePost`, `fanpage.service.ts`, public read API, authorized create API, post card/form UI, and both appointment/shop fanpage routes.
- Driver support includes driver orders dashboard, order driver/assignment APIs, and driver location API.
- Clean release packaging is now a first-class workflow through `scripts/release/create-clean-source.mjs`.

## Current route/API inventory

Use `docs/ROUTE_API_DB_SERVICE_INVENTORY.md` as the route/API/schema/service inventory for future planning. It was regenerated from the source tree on 2026-06-25.

Important currently implemented surfaces:

```txt
/{locale}/appointment/{slug}/fanpage
/{locale}/shop/{slug}/fanpage
/api/public/organizations/{slug}/fanpage/posts
/api/driver/location
/api/orders/{id}/assign-driver
/api/dashboard/notifications
```

## Current fanpage status

Implemented:

- `FanpagePost` Prisma model and migration.
- `FanpageService` for listing/creating posts and revalidating both appointment and shop fanpage paths across configured locales.
- Public `GET /api/public/organizations/{slug}/fanpage/posts`.
- Authorized `POST /api/public/organizations/{slug}/fanpage/posts` for organization `ADMIN`/`MANAGER` sessions.
- Public pages at `/{locale}/appointment/{slug}/fanpage` and `/{locale}/shop/{slug}/fanpage`.
- `FanpagePostCard` and `FanpagePostForm` components.
- FA/EN/AR dictionary parity for fanpage keys, including video placeholder text.

Deferred:

- Likes/reactions.
- Comments/replies.
- Edit/delete/moderation/drafts.
- Follower-only visibility.
- Upload-backed image/video picker from the create form.
- Dashboard post management.

## Known non-blocking debt

- Dashboard/admin Persian copy remains hardcoded in several TS/TSX files. This is reported as warning-level i18n debt, not a blocking validator failure.
- Some older phase docs remain historical and may mention outdated deployed URLs or older smoke-test context.
- The active seed script hashes `123456`, while old console output and older docs said `password123`; Phase 34 docs now document the effective password, but the seed console output should be corrected in a code phase.
- `app/[locale]/dashboard/members/page.tsx` has a suspicious refresh call to `/api/organizations/noId/members`; verify/fix before doing member-management UX work.
- Root and dashboard provider layering should be reviewed before broad client-state/Auth UI refactors.

## Clean release rules

Never hand off a raw archive from the working directory. Use:

```powershell
pnpm run release:zip
```

Do not commit or ship:

```txt
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
.vercel/
.next/
node_modules/
.release/
test-results/
playwright-report/
coverage/
prisma/dev.db
*.dump
*.backup
*.zip
*.rar
public/myResume.pdf
public/uploads/
uploads/
tsconfig.tsbuildinfo
```

## Recommended next phase

```txt
P35 — seed/auth testing cleanup and dashboard members refresh fix
```

Scope:

1. Fix the seed console/password mismatch in `prisma/seed.ts`.
2. Verify seeded username/email/phone login paths against the current auth implementation.
3. Repair the dashboard members refetch path that references `/api/organizations/noId/members`.
4. Keep the change narrow and validate with typecheck, build, `quality:local`, and any focused auth/member tests available.
